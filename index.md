# What's the Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest's goal is to promote and support open-source by encouraging new contributors and new contributions in GitHub.

Whether you are a developer or not, a GitHub guru or completely new to it, if you want to contribute to opensource, or learn how to do it, **register now** and join us.
For those who own projects, this would be a great opportunity to find some contributors to help you.

# What will we do ?
Hacktoberfest—brought to you by DigitalOcean and GitHub—is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like, and ones they’ve just discovered. Everyone can contribute from documentation update to bug fixes
